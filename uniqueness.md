## Uniqueness


The uniqueness of our XLR8 bot was a compact two wheel design to improve the agility and maneuverability around the course that we had to transverse, it also reduced the weight and the footprint of our bot as we were only using two motors instead of four. Another advantage of the two wheeled design was that while executing differential steering mechanism the wheels were not sliding with respect to ground and had pure rotational motion.
