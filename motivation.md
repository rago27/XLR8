# Motivation

After doing ITSP successfully, we had acquired a decent amount of experience with electronics, circuits and motors. 
In XLR8, we saw all the teams making the same generic robot design (4 wheels each powered by a motor). We thought that
such a design would not be challenging enough, so we decided to do something radically different.


After debating and brainstorming among ourselves, we came up with the 2-wheeled robot design. It seemed to be quite unique and
appeared to have some advantages (as listed in the mechanical details). However, after seeing the track we realised that it encourages
the generic design. Nonetheless, we continued and moderately successfully executed our plan.


In the end, we learned a lot about mechanical design, grip, driving dc motors, center of gravity positioning etc. The experience was competitive, 
frustrating (sometimes), educational and most importantly fun! Thanks to ERC for conducting it.
