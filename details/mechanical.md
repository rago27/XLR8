# Mechanical

## Design
For the design of our XLR8 bot we choose a two wheeler design to improve the agility and maneuverability around the course that we had to transverse, it also reduced the weight and the footprint of our bot as we were only using two motors instead of four. Another advantage of the two wheeled design was that while executing differential steering mechanism the wheels were not sliding with respect to ground and had pure rotational motion.

## Challenges And Solutions 

1. The first challenge that we had to overcome was flipping of the chassis about the axis of the wheels, to prevent that we had to add a tail to the design to prevent its flipping, the tail also served another purpose of providing the balancing torque while climbing the slopes, as without the tail there was no force to counter the torque of weight about the contact point of the wheel and the ground, and as a result the bot cannot climb the slopes without the tail to counteract the weight.

2. The second problem that we faced was that our bot was not able to climb up a slope as low as 10 degree even with a tail as our main driving wheels were slipping on the slope as the normal reaction force on our wheels was less than required, for the static friction to come into play. To solve the issue we had to increase the normal reaction. To do that we had to shift the COM away from the contact point of the tail and the ground, which increased the torque of the weight about it. To counteract this torque the normal force betwwen the main wheels and ground has to increase, which gave us the required static friction to climb up the slopes

3. After solving the COM problem we were able to climb slopes of upto 25 degree but not greater than that, To solve this issue we could ahave shifted the COM further away but the length of our bot would have increased drastically and we would have failed at our aim to make a compact design, so we thought of increasing the coefficient of friction between the wheels and the ground, rather than increasing the normal to increase the friction. We achieved this by wrapping rubber bands around the wheels (increased traction).

## conclusions

Our bot had a very steep development curve, we went from not being able to climb up slopes of 10 degree and having a disastrous first run of 8 minutes, to having a laptime of 3 minutes on our second run. Which was more than our expectation as earlier during practice runs we were able to do laptime of sub 2minutes.
